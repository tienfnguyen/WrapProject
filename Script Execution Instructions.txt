You have to run the program as 'python wrap_bot.py'.

How to run this script:

Pre-requisite(s):

1. Install Python Selenium web driver package
2. Test Environment URL: https://www.qa.wrapdev.net/

Purpose of Script:
This is a very simple and dirty script per se to serve the following:
1. Launch the web browser through Selenium
2. Goes to the website
3. Using DOM, it locates the Login button
4. Clicks on it
5. It then locates the 'Sign Up' button
6. It then clicks on the 'Free Small Business' button and enters Username and password

NOTE: There seems to be a bug somewhere on this page because the website thinks the username used
already exists, but if you click on 'Create Account' again after waiting for 5-10 seconds, it then succeeds.

Improvement/Comment:
There are some improvements and optimizations that can be done to this *.py script but overall, it is 
just my idea of how to do it.
Later on in the week, I will attempt to do this in Java with Junit, and possibly later on with testNG.
